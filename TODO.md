## TODO:
There's a bunch of things I want to get done before being ready to go:

* Setup cloud functions for business logic, node is fine
* Setup BLoC maybe? 
* Need to decide on architecture. How quick and dirty?
* How will matchmaking work? a collection of matches?
* How will ranking work? Wins? Elo?
