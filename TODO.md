## TODO:
There's a bunch of things I want to get done before being ready to go:

* Setup cloud functions for business logic, node is fine
* Setup BLoC maybe? 
* Need to decide on architecture. How quick and dirty? 
* How will matchmaking work? a collection of matches?
* How will ranking work? Wins? Elo?

Plan of attack:
* Onboarding, choose your office, put in your name and username
* Homescreen where you can choose your office
* Trade Me rules, markdown rule set held in firestore, or storage?
* My games, has a history of your previous games, changes in score and total score.
